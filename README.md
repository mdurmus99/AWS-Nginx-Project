# **High Availability and Secure Web Application Project with AWS Infrastructure**
This project aims to migrate and effectively manage an existing web application to AWS infrastructure with high availability and security requirements in mind. In this project, a secure and continuously running web application environment will be created by using Nginx web server and integrating AWS services such as automatic scaling and log management.

## **Project Phases**
## 1. Initial Setup and Building Basic Infrastructure
### In this phase, the basic infrastructure of the project will be created:

Virtual Private Network (VPC) Creation: Project-specific public and private subnets as well as routing configurations will be made.

Defining Security Groups: Security groups will be set up to manage inbound and outbound traffic.

## 2. Creating EC2 Instances and Ensuring High Availability
### In this phase, autoscaling and load balancing mechanisms will be set up for high availability of the web application:

Configuring Auto Scaling Groups: EC2 instances will be automatically scaled according to traffic.

Creating Launch Configurations and Templates: Initialization configurations and templates will be defined to manage EC2 instances.

Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) Setup: Load balancing will be achieved by evenly distributing incoming traffic across multiple instances.

## 3. Installation and Configuration of Nginx Web Server
### In this phase, we will install and optimize the Nginx web server:

Nginx Installation: Nginx will be installed on EC2 instances to be used as a web server.

Configuration Optimization: Nginx configuration will be optimized for high performance and security.

## 4. Logging and Monitoring Management
### In this phase, log management and monitoring processes will be discussed:

CloudWatch Logs Integration: Nginx access and error logs will be integrated into CloudWatch Logs.

CloudWatch Alarms: CloudWatch alarms will be set to receive notifications for specific events such as high CPU utilization or increased network traffic.

## 5. Automation with AWS Lambda
### In this phase, automation functions will be created using the AWS Lambda service:

Creating the AWS Lambda Function: Automation functions will be created using AWS Lambda.

Backup Operations: For example, the database will be backed up at regular intervals by creating automated backup functions.
